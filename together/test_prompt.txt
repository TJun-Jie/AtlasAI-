Generate a new schedule represented by a list of event ojects, based on the following tasks and stress scores. 
If the current schedule makes sense, you do not need to change it.
If there is a difference between the new schedule and the old schedule, 
add a new reason field to each rescheduled task and describe the reason for the change.
